README for Machine Learning Approach Towards Crime Prediction Using Criminal Hotspots 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our project relies mainly on pandas, sklearn, numpy and matplotlib. 

Our code submission contains the following files: 
./CompareMontrealTorontoCrime.ipynb <-- compare code of features for Montreal and Toronto 
./MontrealCrimePrediction.ipynb <-- code for the Montreal data processing and prediction 
./TorontoCrimePrediction.ipynb <-- code for the Toronto data processing and prediction 
./Montreal_2015toOct2020.csv <-- raw dataset for Montreal
./pdq.csv <-- raw neighbourhood dataset for Montreal
./Toronto_2014to2019.csv <-- raw dataset for Toronto

* All the files are created in jupyter notebook.
* The files could be run in any order.
* GPU is not required. 
* Execution of all files, it takes ~6 hours. 
* The reports are generated within the notebook cells.
